# Creating the VM

This directory is here only for historical reference.  The scripts
here _might_ still be useful for creating a VM image based on Ubuntu
20.04 Linux, but they are not regularly tested by anyone, so might not
produce a working system.

See the `vm-ubuntu-24.04` [directory](../vm-ubuntu-24.04) for similar
scripts that can be used to create a VM image based on Ubuntu 24.04
Linux.


+ Below are the steps to create a brand new VM using Vagrant:
  + Install [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/installation) on your system if it's not already installed.
  + In a shell/terminal window, change to this `vm-ubuntu-20.04`
    directory inside the `tutorials` directory.
  + Run the below command in the terminal.
    
    ```bash
    vagrant up
    ```

  - This command will initiate the creation of a release VM.
  - The VM will include P4 software installed from pre-compiled packages.
  - You can update these packages using `apt upgrade` within the VM.

+ Alternatively, a development VM can be created by running 
  ```bash
  vagrant up dev
  ```

*Note* that creating a development VM can take several hours,
depending upon the speed of your computer and Internet connection.


## GUI settings that you will likely wish to change

+ Log in as user p4 (password p4)
+ Start menu -> Preferences -> LXQt settings -> Monitor settings
  + Change resolution from initial 800x600 to 1024x768.  Apply the changes.
  + Close monitor settings window
  + *Note*: For some reason I do not know, these settings seem to be
    undone after a reboot, even if I use the "Save" button.  Still,
	you might like to redo this setting each time you boot the system,
	if the screen resolution is too limiting.
+ Several of the icons on the desktop have an exclamation mark on
  them.  If you try double-clicking those icons, it pops up a window
  saying "This file 'Wireshark' seems to be a desktop entry.  What do
  you want to do with it?" with buttons for "Open", "Execute", and
  "Cancel".  Clicking "Execute" executes the associated command.
  If you do a mouse middle click on one of these desktop icons, a
  popup menu appears where the second-to-bottom choice is "Trust this
  executable".  Selecting that causes the exclamation mark to go away,
  and future double-clicks of the icon execute the program without
  first popping up a window to choose between Open/Execute/Cancel.  I
  did that for each of these desktop icons:
  + Terminal
  + Wireshark
+ (optional, if you want a desktop with the P4 logo) Start menu ->
  Preferences -> LXQt settings -> Desktop
  + In "Wallpaper mode" popup menu, choose "Center on the screen".
  + Click Apply button
  + Close "Desktop preferences" window
+ Log off

+ Log in as user vagrant (password vagrant)
+ Change monitor settings and wallpaper mode as described above for
  user p4.
+ Open a terminal.
  + Run the command
    
    ```bash
    ./clean.sh
    ```
    which removes several GigaBytes of files created while building
    the projects.
+ Log off
